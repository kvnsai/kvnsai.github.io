# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to my technical blog—a space where I document my learnings, share insights, and post detailed notes on everything from Linux internals and system design to Kubernetes, containers, security, and more. As I continue growing in my journey, I’ll also be expanding into other areas of tech, capturing my progress and discoveries along the way.
