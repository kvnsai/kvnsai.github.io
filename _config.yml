  Welcome to my technical blog—a space where I document my learnings, share insights, and post detailed notes on everything from Linux internals and system design to Kubernetes, containers, security, and more. As I continue growing in my journey, I’ll also be expanding into other areas of tech, capturing my progress and discoveries along the way.
