# About This Blog
Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This blog is my personal tech corner â€” a living notebook where I share what Iâ€™m learning, experimenting with, and building. Youâ€™ll find posts on topics Iâ€™m passionate about: Linux internals, containers, Kubernetes, system design, security, and a bunch of other low-level and high-level tech.

Think of this space as a blend of documentation, tech deep-dives, practical how-toâ€™s, and raw notes I wish I had when I first stumbled across these topics.

As I grow, this blog will grow with me.


## Under the hood

This blog is built using the Minima theme and powered by **Jekyll**, a simple and blog-aware static site generator that's perfect for developers and tech writers. The site is hosted freely using **GitHub** Pages, which makes maintaining and publishing content incredibly seamless.
