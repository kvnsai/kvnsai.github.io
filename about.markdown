# About This Blog
Hey there 👋

This blog is my personal tech corner — a living notebook where I share what I’m learning, experimenting with, and building. You’ll find posts on topics I’m passionate about: Linux internals, containers, Kubernetes, system design, security, and a bunch of other low-level and high-level tech.

Think of this space as a blend of documentation, tech deep-dives, practical how-to’s, and raw notes I wish I had when I first stumbled across these topics.

As I grow, this blog will grow with me.


## Under the hood
This site is powered by **Jekyll**, using the minimalist and clean Minima theme. I’m hosting it on **GitHub Pages** — because it’s free, version-controlled, and made for  IT enthusisats like us.

## Thanks 
Shoutout to:

The **Jekyll** community — for making it ridiculously easy to start blogging with Markdown

**GitHub** — for letting me host this site for free with just a `git push`
