        <section class="about-text">
          <p> I'm an IT professional with a strong foundation in infrastructure, cybersecurity, and high-performance computing, currently pursuing a Master's in IT and Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. My diverse background includes several years working as an IT Systems Engineer at the Satish Dhawan Space Center (ISRO), where I managed complex infrastructure for space missions. I’m passionate about Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Cybersecurity and DevOps, aiming to design and build resilient, secure systems that drive business success. </p>          
          <p> Currently, I’m working as a Platform Engineer Intern for the HPC department at UT Dallas, developing tools and solutions to improve system performance and reliability. My interests extend to cybersecurity and quantum cryptography, where I’m researching solutions to transition current information systems to post-quantum cryptography. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and strategic vision to contribute to high-impact roles in IT infrastructure and architecture. </p>
